<p class="gmail-p1"><span class="gmail-s1">Kristin was born in Southern California to parents who loved to wander. During her childhood, she spent time Northern California, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and more. Somehow her family always ended up back in Southern California. After graduating high school, she discovered she had her parents wander lust and spent time in Southern California, Nevada, Mexico and few other stops in between before finally settling in the Pacific Northwest.</span> </p>
<p class="gmail-p1"><span class="gmail-s1">During these years Kristin began her career in customer service. She began by investing in one customer at a time by providing world class service to every person she encountered.  While working in customer service for a cable provider she found she was adept at troubleshooting and resolving complex technical problems. Thus, a perfect marriage was born. Combining her love of people with her technical ability, she moved into the world of software project management and never looked back. While having originally cut her teeth on complex software implementations projects as the Implementation Manager with a leading SaaS e-payments security solution in Las Vegas, NV, it was in San Diego where Kristin truly built her impressive Project Management skill set. There she led a team as the Manager of Implementations at a leading aviation ERP solution. Here she honed her management, project leadership, and asset coordination skills.  After relocating to Vancouver, WA she found herself looking for a place to call home. Amongst the opportunities she found, one stood out. Kristin saw in Knowledge Coop an opportunity to join an amazingly dynamic, talented, and diverse team with a close-knit family like culture that drew her in immediately. She knew that this was a company that was going to do amazing things and she wanted to be a part of that.</span> </p>
<p class="gmail-p1"><span class="gmail-s1">When she’s not coordinating, and implementing things Kristin is a voracious reader, a video game and nerd culture aficionado, and the loving and devoted mother of two beautiful cats. Oh, she also spends some time with her human kids. They’re cool too. Beyond that Kristin is a prolific social activist, investing time and resources in local and national causes alike. She also acts as an ambassador to new members of several groups for cancer patients, where her ability to connect with people can serve others in an effort that is very close to home.</span></p>
