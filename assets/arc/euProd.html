  <h3>8 + 2 Hour SAFE Comprehensive Live 2018 Course Overview</h3>
  <div> <span>This year The Knowledge Coop takes a crack at envisioning a new mortgage industry by analyzing the status quo, identifying some of the issues and struggles companies have had with growing too fast that led to damaged cultures and consumer harm, and then creating a plan for a new industry that reaches out to all groups to provide credit to everybody who qualifies. As always, the class has been developed by pouring through the most recent data available and diving deep into a solutions based class with plenty of interaction and our famous gameshow!</span></div>

    <li style="text-align: left;">The NMLS does not allow participants to be on their cell phone during class time. We actively monitor the room to help all participants adhere to the rules.  There are scheduled breaks and lunch for you to return emails, texts, and celebrate closings!  </li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">You may not leave class, except for an urgent restroom break, for more than 5 minutes. If you need accommodation for any personal reasons please reach out to us so we can help set you up for a great experience.</li>
