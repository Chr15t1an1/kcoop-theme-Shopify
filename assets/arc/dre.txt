<p>Andrea was born and raised in the beautiful mountains of Denver, Colorado. After graduation from Clark College with a degree in Business, Andrea worked alongside her father in the auto sales industry. Starting at the bottom, she worked her way up to Customer Relations Manager, and later GM Assistant. The opportunity to work alongside her dad and learn from his wisdom and experience was an amazing, memorable and irreplaceable experience. Through Andrea’s years at the dealership, her main focus was customer service, which she prides herself on to this day. </p>
<p>After 8 years in the Auto Industry, Andrea made a personal decision to leave her position as GM assistant and begin a new journey. That’s when she received a phone call from Ken Perry. Andrea and Ken both played phone tag for a week or so before they finally spoke! Andrea joined The Knowledge Coop team as Coop Coordinator in June 2013, and has been progressing ever since, rising to her current position as National Sales Director. </p>
<p>In addition to business, Andrea also studied Art in college. When she isn’t working, she is an avid photographer, and her work has graced such publications as <em>Capture Southwest Washington</em>. </p>
